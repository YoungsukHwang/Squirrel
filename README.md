# Welcome to Squirrely Worldmap !

## [A description of what has been implemented] </br>
The Great Joffrey Hosencratz wants to keep track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park.
Upon his request, I built an application that can import
[the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)
and allow his team to add, update, and view squirrel data.

What we did in this project is we first started by building the model of the squirrel.

  #### Squarrel: The site directory like mysite. </br>
  #### Tracking: The app directory. This has models.py, views.py, and others as well.
