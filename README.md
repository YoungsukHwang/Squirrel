# Welcome to Squirrely Worldmap !

## [A description of what has been implemented] </br>
The Great Joffrey Hosencratz wants to keep track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park.
Upon his request, I built an application that can import
[the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)
and allow his team to add, update, and view squirrel data.

What we did in this project is we first started by building the model of the squirrel. We then worked on the views and correct linking through the URLS file.

In our project, we developed a web application using django. We also practiced Github for application development with multiple people and developed management commands on Unix for the data ingestion to our model.

  #### Squarrel: The site directory like mysite. </br>
  #### Tracking: The app directory. This has models.py, views.py, and others as well.
